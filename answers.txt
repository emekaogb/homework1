What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
Merging makes a new commit that brings together the changes from 
multiple branches with detailed history, while rebase combines a sequence of 
commits to a new base commit making a linear history.
What is a remote repository?
A repository that exists on a remote machine rather than
a local machine that allows for collaboration.
